- ✅ Consolidated `server/` directory with `api/`, `middleware/`, `routes/`, and `utils/`
- ✅ Maintained `src/` for frontend React components
- ✅ Created `tests/` directory for future test files

### 2. **File Migrations**

- ✅ Moved data files to `data/`
  - CSV files to `data/csv/`
  - JSON files to `data/json/`
- ✅ Organized documentation in `docs/`
  - Architecture docs to `docs/architecture/`
  - Deployment docs to `docs/deployment/`
- ✅ Reorganized scripts in `scripts/`
  - Batch files to `scripts/batch/`
  - Data processing to `scripts/data-processing/`
  - Migration scripts to `scripts/migration/`
- ✅ Consolidated server files in `server/`
  - API routes to `server/routes/`
  - Utilities to `server/utils/`

### 3. **Configuration Updates**
- ✅ Updated `package.json` scripts to reflect new paths
- ✅ Updated batch files with correct script paths
- ✅ Updated migration scripts with new data file paths
- ✅ Created comprehensive diagnostics script
- ✅ Updated README.md with new structure documentation

### 4. **Path Corrections**

## 📋 New Directory Structure

```
PharmGenius/
├── config/          # All configuration files
├── data/            # Data files (CSV, JSON)
├── docs/            # Documentation
├── scripts/         # Utility and migration scripts
├── server/          # Backend server code
├── src/             # Frontend React code
├── public/          # Static assets
├── tests/           # Test files
└── [root files]     # Core project files
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the new structure**
   - Run `npm run check:mongo` to verify paths
   - Test migration scripts
   - Verify server startup

2. **Update any remaining references**
   - Check for hardcoded paths in code
   - Update any external documentation

3. **Consider additional enhancements**
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines
   - Add code quality tools

## 📝 Notes

- All file paths have been updated to work with the new structure
- Package.json scripts reflect the new organization
- Migration and diagnostic scripts use correct data paths
- Documentation has been updated to match the new structure
