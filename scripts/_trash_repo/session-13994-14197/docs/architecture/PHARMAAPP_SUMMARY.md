# 🏥 PharmaApp - Complete Microservices Solution

## ✅ **YES - This App Follows Microservices Rules!**

### 🏗️ **Microservices Architecture Confirmed:**

1. **✅ Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has one specific job
   - SNOMED Service: Medical terminology
   - ICD-10 Service: Medical coding
   - Drug Service: Drug information
   - Auth Service: Authentication
   - Analytics Service: Data analysis

2. **✅ Independent Services**: Each service can run independently
3. **✅ Database Per Service**: Each service has its own database
4. **✅ API Gateway**: Centralized routing and authentication
5. **✅ Service Discovery**: Services communicate through API Gateway
6. **✅ Fault Tolerance**: Services can fail independently
7. **✅ Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently

## 🎨 **Frontend Technology Stack:**

- **✅ React 18** with Vite for fast development
- **✅ Chakra UI** for professional components
- **✅ React Query** for data fetching and caching
- **✅ Axios** for HTTP requests
- **✅ Professional Design**: Blue-to-purple gradients
- **✅ Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle in UI
- **✅ Real-time Health**: Service status monitoring

## 🔗 **Frontend-Backend Connection:**

### ✅ **How It Works:**

```
Frontend (React + Chakra UI) 
    ↓ (API calls)
API Gateway (Port 5000)
    ↓ (routes requests)
Microservices (Ports 5001-5007)
    ↓ (processes data)
Databases (SQLite files)
    ↓ (returns data)
Frontend (displays results)
```

### 📡 **API Endpoints Working:**

```javascript
// Frontend successfully calls these:
GET  /api/health          ✅ System health check
GET  /api/drugs/search    ✅ Search drugs
